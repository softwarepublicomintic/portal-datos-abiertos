# Comment Permissions module

 The Comment Permissions module enables control of commenting by user role and 
 by node type.  Additional user permissions for selected node types are added 
 to the user access system so you can configure commenting with more control 
 than Drupal core provides.

> Note that "reply" links below comments may still appear for users without the 
    permission to add comments.  This is unfortunate, but I haven't found a 
    workaround.  See http://drupal.org/node/185855 for more information.  
    Of course, the links can easily be removed in the theme layer.
