# Comment Permissions Module

## Installation:

1. Place this module directory in your modules folder (this will usually be
   'sites/all/modules/').

2. Enable the module.

3. Go to Administration >> Configuration >> Comment permissions and enable the 
   extended comment permissions for certain content types here.

4. Go to Administration -> People -> Permissions and configure which roles 
   can post comments for the these content types.

> NOTE: Comments must already be enabled for this module to do anything.  
      This module simply removes the ability for a user to post comments if 
      they don't have the right permissions.  
      It does not add the ability to comment on node types that don't have 
      commenting enabled!
